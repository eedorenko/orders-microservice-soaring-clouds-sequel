# Product Consumer Service
This service is responsible for reading  product events generated by users browsing the product
Product Catalogue page and adding items to the shopping cart.

The code is based on the example from Guido Schmutz:
https://github.com/gschmutz/product-soaring-clouds-sequel/tree/master/example/nodejs

## To run:

1) Clone locally all the content of this folder locally

2) Make sure Orders MS is up and running (check out following link for instructions on how to start it up: https://github.com/luisw19/orders-microservice-soaring-clouds-sequel/blob/master/README.md)

3) Install kafka-avro:

```bash
	npm install kafka-avro --save
```

4) Set environment variables as following:

```bash
export KAFKA_BROKER=129.150.77.116:6667
export KAFKA_REGISTRY=http://129.150.114.134:8081
export ORDERSAPI_HOST=127.0.0.1
export ORDERSAPI_PORT=3000
```

5) Then run:

```bash
	node product-subscriber-ms.js
```

6) Add a Product Item to the Kafka Topic "a516817-soaring-add-to-shopping-cart"

```bash
curl -X POST http://129.150.114.134:8080/shoppingCart -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"sessionId":"abbfc4f9-83d5-49ac-9fa5-2909c5dc86e6","customerId":"232422","currency":"USD","quantity":1,"product":{"productId":"abbfc4f9-83d5-49ac-9fa5-2909c5dc86e6","code":"AX329T","name":"Light Brown Men Shoe 1","imageUrl":"01_men_one.jpg","price":68.39,"size":43,"weight":0.0,"dimension":{"unit":"cm","length":10.2,"height":10.4,"width":5.4},"color":"lightbrown","tags":["tag"],"categories":["men"]}}'
```

7) Check that the Shopping Cart Order was created by running the following command (replace HOST and PORT accordingly)

```bash
curl http://$ORDERSAPI_HOST:$ORDERSAPI_PORT/orders?shoppingCart_id=232422&status=SHOPPING_CART
```

8) Add more products to Shopping Cart with same "customerId" and read again the order. See how new lines are added.
